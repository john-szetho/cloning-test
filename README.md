# GitHub Cloning Instructions

Lately cloning repositories between GitHub and VSCode has been causing issues. This may be due to software updates, perhaps something to do with the default name for repo branches changing from `master` to `main`.

See: https://github.com/github/renaming

For future reference, setup repositories by entering the following command in terminal: `git push -u origin main`

Happy coding,
