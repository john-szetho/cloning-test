# GitHub Cloning Instructions

Cloning GitHub repositories from VSCode has not been working. Perhaps due to software updates to do with default repo branch names changing from `master` to `main`.

See: https://github.com/github/renaming

For future reference, setup repositories by entering the following command in terminal: `git push -u origin main`

Happy coding,
